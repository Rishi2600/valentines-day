- This is the typical Valentine's project
- Oldest trick in the book, but still was fun to make, especially with all those maths that were used in this project. Good for building fundamentals.
- I used pure DOM manipulation and pure CSS to make it happen (so yk I put in the effort)
- Send this to your Valentine and make them feel you are a genius prick
- I'll be spamming this to every tech girl too lol
